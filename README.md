Documentation for cMoflon, the eMoflon variant for generating Contiki code
----
## How to set up a small case study (walkthrough)

### Prerequisites:
To use CMoflon you will need Eclipse with Modeling Components as well as Enterprise Architect. Eclipse is freely available from https://eclipse.org/downloads/. You can install a trial version of Enterprise Architect from here: https://www.sparxsystems.de/uml/download-trial/

### How to install cMoflon and specify a sample TC algorithm/test the existing TC algorithms
1. This version of CMoflon has been tested with Eclipse Neon.1a Release (4.6.1) and EMoflon 2.24.0 (RC) and Enterprise Architect
2. To install EMoflon use the following update site: https://emoflon.github.io/eclipse-plugin/emoflon_2.24.0/update-site2/
3. You will also need to install a Plug-In for Enterprise Architect from here: https://emoflon.github.io/eclipse-plugin/emoflon_2.24.0/update-site2/ea-ecore-addin.zip

### How to get Contiki and the evaluation framework
1. Go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/contiki/files/Instant%20Contiki/Instant%20Contiki%203.0/InstantContiki3.0.zip/download and download the Instant Contiki 3.0 VM 
1. Go to https://git.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/michael.stein/topology-control-evaluation and clone the evaluation framework.
1. Store the src folder of the evaluation framework on a portable drive to be able to access it from the VM later.
