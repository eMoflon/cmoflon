# Documentation for cMoflon (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)
Documentation for cMoflon, the eMoflon variant for generating Contiki code

## How to set up a small case study (walkthrough).
1.Prerequisites:
-To use CMoflon you will need Eclipse with Modeling Components as well as Enterprise Architect. Eclipse is freely available from https://eclipse.org/downloads/. You can install a trial version of Enterprise Architect from here: https://www.sparxsystems.de/uml/download-trial/
1. How to install cMoflon and specify a sample TC algorithm/test the existing TC algorithms
- This version of CMoflon has been tested with Eclipse Neon.1a Release (4.6.1) and EMoflon 2.24.0 (RC) and Enterprise Architect
- To install EMoflon use the following update site: https://emoflon.github.io/eclipse-plugin/emoflon_2.24.0/update-site2/
- You will also need to install a Plug-In for Enterprise Architect from here: https://emoflon.github.io/eclipse-plugin/emoflon_2.24.0/update-site2/ea-ecore-addin.zip
1. How to get Contiki and the evaluation framework
- Go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/contiki/files/Instant%20Contiki/Instant%20Contiki%203.0/InstantContiki3.0.zip/download and download the Instant Contiki 3.0 VM 
- Go to https://git.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/michael.stein/topology-control-evaluation and clone the evaluation framework.
- Store the src folder of the evaluation framework on a portable drive to be able to access it from the VM later.
