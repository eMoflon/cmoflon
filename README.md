## How to set up a small case study (walkthrough)

### Setup: How to install cMoflon and all required software
The currently requires a mixed environment with a Windows system (for cMoflon/eMoflon and Enterprise Architect) and a Linux VM (provided as Instant Contiki).
This version of cMoflon has been tested with Eclipse Neon.2 Release (4.6.1) and eMoflon 2.26.0 and Enterprise Architect 12

1. Install *Eclipse with Modeling Components*, available here: https://eclipse.org/downloads/
1. Install a 30-days trial version of Enterprise Architect from here: https://www.sparxsystems.de/uml/download-trial/
1. To install eMoflon in Eclipse use the following update site: https://emoflon.github.io/eclipse-plugin/emoflon_2.24.0/update-site2/
1. You will also need to install an addin for Enterprise Architect from here: https://emoflon.github.io/eclipse-plugin/emoflon_2.24.0/update-site2/ea-ecore-addin.zip
1. Install the cMoflon feature
  * Update Site: http://emoflon.github.io/cmoflon/update-site/
  * You may also use the Install button at the beginning of this document.
1. Download the Instant Contiki 3.0 VM from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/contiki/files/Instant%20Contiki/Instant%20Contiki%203.0/InstantContiki3.0.zip/download and 
1. Clone the Contiki evaluation framework from here (non-public): https://git.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/michael.stein/topology-control-evaluation
 * A snapshot of the proper version will be made available later.
 * The root folder of the working copy will be refered to as *TCEval* in the following.
 
## How to specify a sample TC algorithm/test the existing TC algorithms
1. Start Eclipse and navigate to *File->New->Other->eMoflon* and select *New cMoflon Metamodel Wizard* add a name and finish
1. This will create a new project, a so-called metamodel project. Open it and double-click the *.eap file
1. Specify your TC algorithm or algorithms according to the pre-implemented ones.
1. Hit the *Validate* button and select your project in eclipse and refresh it. This will create two new projects, named after the corresponding ECore Package in Enterprise Architect.
 * The project ending with _C contains the Contiki code
 * The other project contains regular EMF code (e.g., for unit testing or Java-based debugging).
1. Inside the Contiki project (the one ending with _C), the two *.properties files serve for customizing the generated code. Fill those according to the instructions
1. Select the Contiki project and hit the blue build button, the generated code is placed in the /gen folder.

### How to test a TC algorithm generated by cMoflon in Cooja Simulator
Cooja is the network simulator that ships with Contiki.
It is quite a powerful simulator for a first test of your code.

1. Store the *TCEval/src* folder of the evaluation framework on a portable drive to be able to access it from the VM later.
1. Copy both generated files into the folder *TCEval/src/components/topologycontrol/*
1. Add a line for the .c file to *TCEval/src/components/topologycontrol/Makefile*
1. Add the new constant (found in the .c file in the PROCESS section) to *TCEval/src/app-conf-constants.h*
1. Copy *TCEval/src/app-conf-default*, remove the *_default* suffix and adjust the settings within to your wishes
1. Copy *TCEval/src/Makefile-conf-default.include*, remove the *_default*, link to the contiki path in the vm, and **do not use** IPv6
1. Alternatively you can use the files provided inside the /resources folder.
1. Start the VM, and mount the portable drive.
1. Open a terminal and navigate to */contiki/tools/cooja* and use the command ```ant run``` to start the Cooja Simulator.
1. Hit *CTRL+N* to create a new simulation
1. Navigate to *Motes->Add motes->Create New Mote Type -> Sky mote*, browse to *TCEval/src/app.c*, and hit compile.
1. After compiling is done, create the motes and run the simulation.

### How to test a TC algorithm generated by cMoflon using FlockLab
FlockLab (https://www.flocklab.ethz.ch/) is a wireless sensor testbed at ETH Zurich.

1. You will need a Flocklab account for testing so create one here: https://www.flocklab.ethz.ch/user/login.php
1. Follow all the Steps for Cooja until compilation has terminated.
1. Then, unmount the drive from the VM
1. Go to the test image section (https://www.flocklab.ethz.ch/user/images.php) and upload the compiled *app.sky* file, located in *TCEval/src*.
1. Copy the ImageID into the xml configuration provided in the */resources* folder in the Eclipse Project and then upload it to the test section
1. After the Test is run, you will receive an e-mail with the results in a zip folder.
