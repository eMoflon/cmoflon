## SHARE VM
We invite you to try out cMoflon using the following SHARE VM:
* URL: <a href="http://is.ieis.tue.nl/staff/pvgorp/share/?page=ConfigureNewSession&vdi=XP-TUe_RK_cMoflon_ECMFA2017.vdi" title="" target="_blank">XP-TUe_RK_cMoflon_ECMFA2017.vdi</a> in <a href="http://fmt.cs.utwente.nl/redmine/projects/grabats/wiki" target="_blank"><img src="http://is.ieis.tue.nl/staff/pvgorp/share/images/share-logo-16full.png" alt="Online demo in SHARE" title="Sharing Hosted Autonomous Research Environments" border="0" style="vertical-align: text-top"></a>
* User: sharevm[A}es[D}tu-darmstadt[D}de ([A} = @, [D} = ., [E} = !)
* Passsword: ShareVM[A}RealTime[E}

### Getting started

* After starting a SHARE VM session, you see a Windows desktop.
* Double-click the Icon *Eclipse Neon 3* to start Eclipse.
* You are now faced with an Eclipse workspace that contains three working sets (see *Package Explorer* on the left)
   1. Working set *cMoflonDemo* contains the specification (Project *cMoflonDemo*) and source code (Project *cMoflonDemo*, *gen* folder)
   1. Working set *cMoflonSource* contains the sources code of cMoflon
   1. Working set *ToCoCoSource* contains the source code of ToCoCo
* The following subsections describe how to explore the provided resources.

### Exploring cMoflonDemo

* To see the metamodel of the demo and the topology control algorithm specifications, open the *cMoflonDemo* project.
* Then, double-click the file *cMoflonDemo.eap*.
* The modeling tool *Enterprise Architect* opens up.

* To the left, you see the *Project browser* with two elements.
* Open the *cMoflon Demo* element, and then the *EPackage cMoflonLanguage*
* The two entries *cMoflonDemo* and *cMoflonDemoAlgorithms* are diagrams that provide an overview of the metamodel and can be opened by double-clicking.
* To examine the specification of one of the topology control algorithms, 
   1. open *cMoflonDemoAlgorithms*,
   1. select *+ run(): void* in *LmstAlgorithm* (or *KtcAlgorithm* or *LStarKtcAlgorithm*), and
   1. press Enter or double-click *+ run(): void* once again.
* The generated .c and .h files can be found in the Eclipse project *cMoflonDemoLanguage_C* in the *gen* folder. These files can be copy-and-pasted into the appropriate folder for the topology control component of ToCoCo (see below).
   
### Exploring cMoflonSource
* To examine the cMoflon code generator, open the Eclipse project *org.cmoflon.ide.core* and navigate to */src/org.cmoflon.ide.core.runtime.codegeneration/CMoflonCodeGenerator.java*

### Exploring ToCoCoSource
* The Eclipse project *ToCoCoSource* contains the full source code of the ToCoCo 2.0.0 ramework
* The *components* folder is structured along the main components in ToCoCo.
* The *components/topologycontrol* folder contains the manually implemented topology control algorithms (a-)kTC, l*-kTC, LMST, and NoTC.
   * To use the generated topology control algorithms, the generated .c and .h files need to be placed in this folder and the *Makefile* needs to be adjusted accorindly.

## Size comparison of eMoflon and cMoflon
We have counted the lines of code in the code bases of eMoflon 2.28.0 and cMoflon 1.0.0.
